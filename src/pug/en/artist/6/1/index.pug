        p In 2014, there was a voice in my heart: "How about making a necklace about the womb?" 
        p When I heard this question arise within me, a great curiosity about the womb began. I wondered about my body, why did I never think about it? What does the womb mean to women? What is the story behind it? How can I make this necklace about a womb if I don't even know my own womb? What materials and techniques should I apply? I couldn't come up with a sketch, so I got an idea: maybe I could invite friends to paint the womb together and see what happens?
        p This womb necklace was successfully created. At the same time, life led me to another creative possibility.
        p.
