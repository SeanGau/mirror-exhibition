                    I exist in the incredible sea of clouds.<br>
                    I am here among the countless adorned flowers,<br>
                    The dust on the ground is me and is you,<br>
                    The twinkling stars in the sky, the blossoming of light and shadow on the blade tips,<br>
                    The lines of the palms, the wrinkles at the end of the eyes,<br>
                    Every moment has my gesture, my voice.<br>
                    All coincidences are not coincidences, they are all chosen.<br>
                    On this road, child, don't forget,<br>
                    Your root, your source."
                p For me, creative practice is like a mirror, reflecting who I am, where my root is, where I come from. From previous goldsmith work "Origin" to the art project "My Womb, My Mother Earth" what I seek is actually the source of life, the creation of the heart.
                p After a four-year art project, I gradually realized that this is a creative practice of walking into the inner-self. For me, it has been an unparalleled journey of healing. My once-shattered female power grew again, only because of an inner confidence, a steadfast strength, and a desire to share. We forget that we are also a part of nature, and all things are contained and integrated. The womb is the root of a woman. Connecting to flowers and trees, mountains and seas, and animal power, these wild beauties come from the nurture of the earth, and I dedicate this retrospective to the art project.

From 2015 to 2017, she created a series of large-scale sculptures, taking the concept of the womb as the origin to source an uninterrupted flow of vitality. Lin invited women, children and men to co-create and participate in the art project"My Womb, My Mother Earth". She is also active in the fields of curation, spatial design, etc.
