                p The original soil refers to the wild soil, which is directly collected from the land in different regions. From left to right, each was collected from Cayamavana village, Alishan; Dulan town, Taitung; Donghe township, Taitung; and Linkou, New Taipei City. After the collection, the soil was softened with water, and then sieved and processed into clay that can be sculpted. The change of soil into this state is also related to the state in which it is actually used.

                    Watering is the main interaction as well as the key to adjustment while doing pottery. Water allows me to see the living state of the clay. Working with the soft, moist clay is also the most healing moment during the process.

                p.
                    I put the three most common states of pottery making in water. Arranged from top to bottom, they are pottery sintered at high temperature, pottery kneaded and molded at room temperature, pottery bisque fired at low temperature, which is still permeable. Water is the most commonly used medium in the production process, which presents the states of pottery explicitly.

                p Rolling and colliding, these are the experiments I have done with clay, trying to reach the balance between utility and creativity while making pottery.

                h2 Fragment
                p The shaking sound can tell how much water is in the container, louder means less water. Inside the container are ceramic balls. This was inspired by my visit to an Izakaya, where the drinking vessels they use make such kind of sounds. Here is a small snippet of my experience with the utensils. When the owner recounted how this drinking vessel is used, I felt his life.
                p After a pottery is completely fired and formed, how it is used is a state of returning to life.
                p.
                    Drinking from a pottery cup; eating from a pottery bowl is such an ordinary way of living, but it is the easiest thing to be neglected. After seeing how poetry has been used in other cultures, I suddenly recalled the forgotten feeling of life. Therefore, I elaborated such a slice of life. <br>
                    This is also the living feeling that ceramic gives me, revolving throughout my everyday life.

                p The most healing thing about pottery for me is actually the "process" before clay sinters into ceramic. In the past, I could only present the final results to others, but the works exhibited this time allowed me to go back to the very beginning of a healing state.
                p I divided the soil I collected into five stages: soil, clay, bisque-firing (a state that can still absorb water), and high-temperature firing (sintering), trying to present the sense of healing I felt during these processes. This is like the living states of earth, as well as the faces of my life.
                p "life" was chosen as the motif of this work. I do not want to address it in a too serious way. "life" refers to the process of living. The clay has a memory. It records the time and strength I use to shape and adjust it. It also records my condition at every moment. While looking at the clay in its state, I feel like I am looking at the distance I have traveled.
