                p Mirror — An Online Exhibition about the Craft of Healing shows how artists derive healing power from craft practice. Departing from the exhibition manner in which the final product of art is displayed in a physical space, the participating artists conceptualize craft works and present them through text, video and sound, in an online exhibition. They lead the audience to explore the "creative process" that brings about healing.
                p Invited by the OR Craft Life, the curatorial team has planned an extra part of the exhibition, Mirror X OR Craft Life: A Pop-up exhibition, in which the combination of documentary and dance video work of the derivative project "Embrace" is broadcast. Starting from the creative process of craft artists, the video pitched the topic from four sub-topics, which are Sound, Touch, Time, and Symbiosis. It documents the transition of the artist throughout the creative process, as well as the changes in body rhythm, perception and mood caused by different incidents, turning it into a dance video to be narrated. Further, some of the works from the participating artists in Mirror and their other series of handicraft works are also displayed on site. We hope the audience can not only take on the core value of these artistic practice through the form of online exhibition, but also see the physical texture of these works in person.
