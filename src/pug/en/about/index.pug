                h6.mb-4 Mirror — An Online Exhibition about the Craft of Healing
                p: i "Learn to see and to feel life; that is, cultivate imagination, because there are still marvels in the world, because life is a mystery and always will be. But be aware of it." ~Josef Albers
                p Mirror — An Online Exhibition about the Craft of Healing invited eight artists to look back at the core of their creative practice, trying to sensualize emotions and process them in an intuitive way. Artists get to know themselves better through philosophical speculation, search for a sense of belonging in light and shadow, keep notes of different situations and states of life through meditation, and also confront, reflect on and repair a relationship, learning to heal a wounded heart. They shift between aspiration, projection and transformation.
                p In the process of their creative practice, the artists shape the objects before them into the appearance in their mind, feeling the materials attentively with their hands, and leaving a unique imprint on the works with repetitive motions and the body’s labor. The final manifestation of a work also shows the artist’s autonomy, time and effort. The surprise brought by the unknown in the creative process is always the most interesting part. Perhaps, trusting their inner guidance makes the artists keep going.
                p The essence of the creative practice is exploring beauty, as well as exploring oneself, so as to understand oneself. If an artwork can bring such core concepts to an audience, trigger their empathy, and then make that audience face their emotions willingly, and achieve integration, the true meaning of healing will then be realized.
                p In this online exhibition, we expect the artwork to serve as a mirror. When the work sits before the artist, it reflects the creator’s inner world and their personal growth through the practice. When the work sits before an audience, not only does it create a sensory experience, we hope it also resounds with the deepest voice within them.
